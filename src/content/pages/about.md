Founded as the Microsoft Amateur Radio Club, we bring together radio operators passionate about digital communications, technical innovation, and advancing the amateur radio hobby. The club includes a broad range of people, primarily from our local tech industry, who participate in many aspects of our hobby. Our goal is to promote the knowledge of amateur radio, serve our community by through a broad range of experience and talents as radio operators, and to be a resource for all hams.

Our members include technical professionals, hardware engineers, software developers, time nuts, students, educators, and radio hobbyists. Many of our members currently are or have in past contributed to notable organizations and projects in the Pacific Northwest that continue to have a positive impact on the amatuer radio community.

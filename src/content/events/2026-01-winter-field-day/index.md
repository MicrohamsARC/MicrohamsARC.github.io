Winter Field Day is an annual amateur radio tradition taking place on the last full weekend of January (January 24-25, 2026). Now in its 19th year, WFD challenges operators to set up portable field stations and make contacts in winter conditions—rain, snow, ice, or shine.

## Why Winter?

The Winter Field Day Association passionately believes that emergency communications training shouldn't be limited to fair-weather scenarios. Natural disasters are unpredictable and can strike when you least expect them. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and other hazards present unique operational concerns that are valuable to practice before you need them for real.

**Core principles:**
- Natural disasters are unpredictable and can strike when you least expect them
- Your training and operating skills should not be limited to fair-weather scenarios  
- Preparedness is the key to a professional and timely response during any event

- **Duration:** 24 hours (1900 UTC Saturday to 1900 UTC Sunday)

## A Brief History

Winter Field Day began in January 2007, organized by SPAR (The Society for the Preservation of Amateur Radio) after Charles, N5PVL, proposed the idea in 2006. What started as an experiment quickly became an annual tradition. In 2015, the Winter Field Day Association (WFDA) was formed to continue the event, and it has grown ever since—processing over 2,500 logs from stations worldwide in 2022.

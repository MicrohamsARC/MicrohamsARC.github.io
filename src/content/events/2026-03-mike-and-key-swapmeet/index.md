The Mike & Key Electronics Show & Swap Meet is one of the largest annual Amateur Radio events in the Pacific Northwest. Up to 3,000 hams and non-hams alike are drawn to this modern 40,000+ square foot facility. MicroHAMS members always turn up to this event. In 2025 we held informational sessions on the second floor of the venue to educate and take questions on a variety of ham radio related topics. Discussions are underway to repeat this in 2026 so let us know if you are interested in helping.

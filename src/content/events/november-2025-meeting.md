## Presentation: Restoring the Apollo Guidance Computer

This month we're thrilled to welcome **Marc Verdiell**, Chief Technology Officer of the Samtec Optical Group, who will present on the remarkable restoration of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) in time for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.

The AGC was the groundbreaking computer that navigated Apollo spacecraft to the moon and back, including the critical landing and ascent of the Lunar Modules. Marc will share the fascinating story of how his restoration team brought this rare piece of computing history back to life, overcoming challenges that included recreating obsolete 1960s-era connectors that were no longer available.

### About the Presenter

**Marc Verdiell** is the Chief Technology Officer of the Samtec Optical Group in Santa Clara, California, and a renowned vintage computer restoration expert. Marc is a volunteer member of the restoration team at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where he previously worked on restoring the iconic IBM 1401 mainframe from the early 1960s.

Marc teamed up with fellow restorers Carl Claunch and Ken Shirriff to successfully restore a rare Xerox Alto—the computer that inspired Steve Jobs to create the first Macintosh. Their 18-month Alto restoration project was chronicled on YouTube and made them well-known in the computer restoration community. Following this success, the team was contacted to take on an even rarer challenge: restoring an Apollo Guidance Computer for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.

Marc combines his expertise in cutting-edge optical technology with a deep appreciation for computing history, making him uniquely qualified to bridge the gap between 1960s aerospace engineering and modern restoration techniques.

### The Apollo Guidance Computer Story

The computer Marc's team restored has a remarkable history. In 1976, Jimmie Loocke, a former NASA Manned Spacecraft Center technician, discovered two tons of Apollo project materials—including a Lunar Module AGC—at a recycler's warehouse and saved them from being scrapped. Years later, in 2004, when Eldon Hall (the original chief architect of the AGC) examined Loocke's computer, they discovered it was in pristine condition and not potted—making it a potential candidate for restoration.

The restoration involved recreating vintage connectors that Samtec had never manufactured (the company opened in 1976, after the Apollo era), using only original prints as reference. Marc will share the technical challenges, clever solutions, and teamwork that went into bringing this piece of space history back to operational status.

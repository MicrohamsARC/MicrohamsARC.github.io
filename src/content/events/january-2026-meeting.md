### Modernizing RF Sample Transport

This month we kick off our series of 2026 presentations with a discussion on modernizing the path that our transceivers must take to deliver sampled RF to digital mode applications. Current workflows often model this path as a convoluted chain of device drivers, virtual audio devices, and more to deliver PCM packets to software (and back). This talk deconstructs the actual sample path for two implementations: USB audio, and VITA-49. The goal is to investigate how we might modernize the way we handle RF sampling to eliminate stages, improve performance, and create a pracical transport chain that can differentiate between handling I/Q data and Youtube audio.

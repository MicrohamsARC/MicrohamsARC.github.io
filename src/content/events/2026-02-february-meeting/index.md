## Presentation

This month's member meeting has two presentations:

### Updates from Hamcation - Scott Honaker, N7SS

Scott is just back and hot off the plane from the first big show of the season: Hamcation. He will give us some highlights and news from the event. Scott's updates are always interesting to hear, and often gives a peek into what's to come for the year.

### Modernizing Critical Ham Radio Software - Brian Stucker, KB2S

Brian will be presenting on modernization of critical station automation software and preserving critical ham-radio infrastructure. Small utilities such as TQSL keep the Logbook of the World running, are a fun part of the hobby, and enable larger events like DXpeditions to process thousands of QSOs. He'll explain why small utilities like TQSL matter, describe the fragile state of the existing toolchain, and share his work rebuilding TQSL in Go and republishing a more resilient documentation site. Brian will demo the new distribution, walk through the lessons learned about portability and maintainability, and discuss steps for community stewardship.

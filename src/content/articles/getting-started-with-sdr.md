Software Defined Radio (SDR) has revolutionized amateur radio operations by replacing traditional hardware components with software processing. This guide will help you understand the basics and get started with your first SDR setup.

## What is SDR?

SDR technology moves the traditional radio signal processing from hardware circuits to software running on a computer or embedded system. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Flexibility**: Update and modify radio functionality through software
- **Cost-effective**: One device can serve multiple purposes
- **Learning tool**: Visualize and understand radio signals in real-time

## Popular SDR Hardware

### RTL-SDR

The RTL-SDR is the most affordable entry point into SDR. Originally designed as a TV tuner, it's been repurposed by the amateur radio community.

**Specifications:**
- Frequency range: 24 MHz - 1766 MHz
- Sample rate: Up to 2.4 MSPS
- Price: $25-40

### HackRF One

For those needing transmit capability, the HackRF One provides full-duplex operation.

**Specifications:**
- Frequency range: 1 MHz - 6 GHz
- Half-duplex transceiver
- Price: $300-350

## Software Options

Several excellent software packages work with SDR hardware:

1. **SDR#** - Windows-only, beginner-friendly
2. **GQRX** - Linux and macOS support
3. **GNU Radio** - Advanced signal processing framework

## Next Steps

Once you have your hardware and software set up, consider:

- Joining local amateur radio clubs
- Participating in digital modes
- Experimenting with satellite reception
- Building your own antennas

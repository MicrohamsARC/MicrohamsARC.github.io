January 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting month for DXers, with several notable expeditions either on the air or coming soon. Here's a roundup of what's happening, with links to follow along.

## KP5/NP3VI — Desecheo Island (Active Now!)

The big one. **Desecheo Island (KP5)** is currently the **14th most wanted DXCC entity worldwide** and hasn't been activated since K5D in 2009. The KP5/NP3VI team went QRV on January 12, 2026, and plans to stay on the air for **30 continuous days**.

This is a landmark operation—the first Puerto Rican-led DXpedition to Desecheo in 48 years (since KP4AM/D in 1978). The team is using an innovative remote operating approach with two self-sustained Remote Deployment Units (RDUs) provided by the Manyana DX Foundation, operating via Remote Ham Radio (RHR) infrastructure.

**Key details:**
- **Bands:** 10m, 12m, 15m, 17m, 20m, 30m, 40m (160m added!)
- **Modes:** CW, SSB, FT8
- **QSL:** via M0OXO
- **Livestream:** [Club Log Livestream](https://clublog.org/livestream/KP5/NP3VI)
- **Website:** [desecheo2026.com](https://desecheo2026.com/kp5/)

The operation has received $10,000 in support from NCDXF and backing from INDEXA. As of January 15, they're working through pileups with a focus on delivering ATNOs to as many operators as possible. European and southern hemisphere stations: keep trying—the team is aware of propagation challenges and is adjusting schedules.

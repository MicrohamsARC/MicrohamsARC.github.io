Digital modes have become increasingly popular in amateur radio, offering efficient communication even under poor propagation conditions.

## Popular Digital Modes

### FT8

FT8 is a weak-signal mode designed for minimal signal-to-noise ratios. It's become the most popular digital mode for DX contacts.

- **Transmission length**: 15 seconds
- **Bandwidth**: 50 Hz
- **Minimum SNR**: -20 dB

### PSK31

Phase Shift Keying is ideal for keyboard-to-keyboard conversations.

- **Bandwidth**: 31.25 Hz
- **Speed**: ~50 words per minute
- **Best for**: Real-time QSOs

## Getting Started

To begin with digital modes, you'll need:

1. An HF transceiver
2. A computer with sound card
3. Interface cable (USB or traditional)
4. Software (WSJT-X for FT8, Fldigi for PSK31)

## Best Practices

- Always identify your station properly
- Monitor before transmitting
- Use appropriate power levels
- Follow band plans for digital operation

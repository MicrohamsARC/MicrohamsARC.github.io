## Presentation: Amateur Radio Pro Tips

This month, we look forward to hearing from club members about their amateur radio "pro tips." These are nuggets of wisdom or experience that you've gained over the years that you'd like to share with the club.

Example Pro Tips:
- How to make a "good enough" filter to block out a nearby station with random pieces of coax
- How to know when a station you're looking for might be active (hint: PJ6Y will be our working example)
- Tips on connecting your Mac to an IC-705 without any Windows OS emulation
- Insights from the Microwave Update conference in Tuscon, where keynote speakers are rebuilding the nav and comms equipment from the Apollo missions

Bring your own piece of wisdom and share with us! We have a member (Robin W7YED) who is active in Saba as PJ6Y right now—maybe he will join us! Lots of fun things going on!

## How to Use

### Creating a New Event

1. Create a new markdown file in `content/events/`
2. Add front matter with event details:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Event Title"
   description: "Brief description"
   eventDate: 2025-12-01
   startTime: "7:00 PM PST"
   location: "Event Location"
   eventType: "meeting"
   featured: true
   tags: ["monthly-meeting", "guest-speaker"]
   ---
   ```
3. Write event content in markdown
4. Run `npm run build`

### Featuring on Homepage

Set `featured: true` in the front matter. Only the next upcoming featured event will appear on the homepage.

### Adding Virtual Attendance

Include the `virtualLink` field:
```yaml
virtualLink: "https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/..."
```

This adds "Join Virtual Meeting" buttons throughout the site.

### Event Types

Choose the appropriate type for automatic badge coloring:
- `meeting` - Monthly member meetings
- `conference` - MHDC and other conferences  
- `field-day` - Field Day operations
- `contest` - Contest events
- `social` - Club socials and gatherings
- `workshop` - Training and workshops

## Design System Integration

All event pages use the established design system:
- **ITCSS Architecture** - Settings, Tools, Generic, Elements, Objects, Components, Utilities
- **OKLCH Colors** - Modern color space with consistent lightness
- **Typography Scale** - Perfect Fourth (1.333) scale
- **Layout Primitives** - Region, Wrapper, Stack, Cluster, Grid, Center, Box
- **Component Variants** - Cards, buttons, badges with consistent styling

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<article>`, `<time>`, `<nav>`)
- ARIA labels for navigation
- Keyboard-accessible interactive elements
- Proper datetime attributes for dates
- Color contrast compliant badges and text
- Descriptive link text

## Navigation Updates

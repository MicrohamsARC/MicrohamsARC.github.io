# Clickable Cards Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced article cards to be fully clickable, improving user experience by allowing users to click anywhere on the card to navigate to the article, not just the title link.

## Implementation Date

October 21, 2025

## Changes Made

### CSS Enhancement

**File:** `src/styles/05-components/_components.css`

Added "stretched link" pattern to make entire cards clickable:

```css
.card {
  position: relative;  /* Required for stretched link positioning */
  /* ... existing styles ... */
}

/* Stretch the first link in card title to cover entire card */
.card__title a:first-child::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Ensure other interactive elements in the card are above the stretched link */
.card a:not(.card__title a),
.card button {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}
```

## How It Works

### Stretched Link Pattern

The implementation uses a CSS pseudo-element (`:after`) to create an invisible clickable overlay:

1. **Card Container** - Set to `position: relative` to establish positioning context
2. **Stretched Link** - The title link's `::after` pseudo-element is positioned absolutely with `inset: 0` to cover the entire card
3. **Z-Index Layering** - The pseudo-element sits at `z-index: 1`, while other links/buttons are at `z-index: 2` to remain clickable

### Benefits

- ✅ **Larger Click Target** - Entire card is clickable (improves usability)
- ✅ **Accessibility Maintained** - Screen readers still see the title link as the primary action
- ✅ **Semantic HTML** - No changes to HTML structure required
- ✅ **Future-Proof** - Other interactive elements (buttons, secondary links) remain functional
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement** - Falls back gracefully if CSS is disabled

## Affected Components

All cards with `card__title` links throughout the site:

### Homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`)
- Featured Articles cards
- Active Projects cards

### Articles Listing (`src/pages/articles/index.astro`)
- Article list cards

### Projects Listing (`src/pages/projects/index.astro`)
- Project cards

### Docs Listing (`src/pages/docs/index.astro`)
- Documentation cards

### Events Listing (`src/pages/events/index.astro`)
- Past events cards (upcoming events already use horizontal card--horizontal layout)

## Technical Details

### CSS Specificity

The selector `.card__title a:first-child::after` ensures:
- Only applies to the first link in the card title
- Doesn't affect cards without title links
- Pseudo-element can be overridden if needed

### Z-Index Stack

```
z-index: 2  → Other links/buttons (secondary actions)
z-index: 1  → Stretched link overlay
z-index: 0  → Card content (default layer)
```

### Browser Support

The `inset` shorthand is supported in:
- Chrome/Edge 87+
- Firefox 66+
- Safari 14.1+
- Opera 73+

**Fallback:** Older browsers ignore the `inset` property; cards remain clickable via title link only.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Only the title text was clickable
- Small click target (title width)
- Inconsistent click behavior across card

### After
- Entire card is clickable
- Large click target (full card area)
- Consistent hover state
- Visual feedback (cursor: pointer) across entire card

## Accessibility Considerations

### Maintained Features
- ✅ **Semantic Link** - Title link remains the semantic anchor
- ✅ **Screen Reader** - Announced as single link with title text
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab focuses title link, Enter activates
- ✅ **Focus Indicator** - Visible focus ring on title link

### Best Practices
- Title link text clearly describes destination
- Card hover state provides visual feedback
- Interactive variant (`data-variant="interactive"`) sets cursor to pointer
- No hidden text or aria labels required

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Cards clickable across entire area
- [x] Title link still visible and functional
- [x] Hover state works on entire card
- [x] Cursor changes to pointer over card
- [x] Other links/buttons in cards still work (if present)
- [x] Keyboard navigation unaffected
- [x] Screen readers announce correctly
- [x] All 11 pages build successfully
- [x] No visual regressions

## Performance Impact

**Minimal:** 
- Only CSS changes (no JavaScript)
- No additional DOM elements
- Pseudo-element creates no reflow
- Build time unchanged: ~650ms for 11 pages

## Design System Integration

This enhancement aligns with existing patterns:
- Uses existing `.card` component structure
- Respects `data-variant="interactive"` for cursor styling
- Maintains visual hierarchy
- Follows Vignelli principle: improve usability without adding complexity

## Examples in the Wild

This pattern is used by major sites:
- **Bootstrap** - `.stretched-link` utility class
- **GitHub** - Repository cards
- **Dribbble** - Shot cards
- **Medium** - Article cards

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add analytics tracking for card clicks
- Add visual indicator (arrow/chevron) on card hover
- Extend pattern to other card types (project cards, doc cards)
- Add animation on card hover (scale, lift effect)
